In this post, I will discuss some common object-oriented programming (OOP) design patterns. Unlike previous posts, I will try to use [Feynman technique](https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/). That being said, I will try to limit the word account to 50 to explain what each design pattern is and I want to know if you can understand, if not thoroughly, the gist of each of them. I will also include elobaration at the end, for the sake of tutorial and self-refresh.
