        <p>Welcome to my blog. I am a UNC alumni and am currently pursing master degree in the field of computer science at CMU.</a> 
           <br><br>My primary interests lie in cloud computing, software development and machine learning yet I am generally curious about any rigorous disciplines. 
           I am keeping this blog to record some tutorials/notes that I use for my study, my thoughts on news, as well as some random ideas. Hopefully it can 
           give insights to people who come across.</p>
        
        <p>I have also maintained a <a href="#" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: line-through; color: #3c484e;">personal web profile</a>(under construction), if you are intereted in knowing more about me.</p>
