        <p>Welcome to my blog. I am a UNC alumni and am currently pursing a master's degree in the field of computer science at CMU.</a> 
           <br><br>My primary interests lie in software development, cloud technology and recently securities, yet I am generally curious about any rigorous disciplines. 
           Outside of tech, I also take an interest in fashion, sports and finance, which I might touch on a bit on this blog every now and then. I am keeping this blog 
           to mostly record some tutorials/notes that I've been using for my study, my thoughts, as well as some random stuff. Hopefully it can give some insights to people 
           who come across.</p>
        
        <p>I have also maintained a <a href="#" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: line-through; color: #3c484e;">personal web profile</a>(<b>under construction</b>) if you are intereted in knowing more about me.</p>
