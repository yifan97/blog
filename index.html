        <p>I am currently a Computer Science and Mathematics undergraduate from <a href="https://www.unc.edu/" target="_blank">The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a>. 
           <br><br>My primary interests lie in the field of machine learning and software development. I am also a teaching enthusiast and I'd love to share my thoughts on tech topics and hopefully give insights to people who came aross my blog.</p>
		<p>In my free time, I love to explore ideas and topics in tons of fields, including but not limited to academia, sports, traveling, etc. This blogging website is for recording some tutorials/notes that I used for my study, my thoughts on recent news, as well as some random articles.</p>
        
        <p>I have also maintained a <a href="#" target="_blank">personal web profile</a>, if you are intereted in knowing more about me</p>
